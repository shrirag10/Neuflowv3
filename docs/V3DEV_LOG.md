# v3-dev running log

Branch policy: v3-dev = v2-dev (trusted code) + new work. Nothing from the
v3-rebuild decoder rewrite is merged until it is independently validated;
the rebuild branch stays untouched for reference.

Every entry: what changed, why, and its verification status.

## 2026-07-27

- **Branch created** from v2-dev.
- **Ported from v3-rebuild (decoder-independent, additive only):**
  `hpc/` (bootstrap, env-setup job, download scripts, all sbatch files),
  `scripts/train_distill.py` (option A), `data_utils/datasets.py` +
  `frame_utils.py` (Spring loader + grand_mix/spring_mix stages, flo5 reader).
  NOT ported: `NeuFlow/` rewrite, deck builder edits.
- **hpc/train_big18.sbatch**: batch-16, 100K-step vkitti2_mix run at the
  (1,8) schedule on v2-dev code. Replaces the rebuild's "rebuild_big/18" runs
  as the scale-up experiment. Status: created, submission pending env job.
- **Option A (refinement self-distillation)** `scripts/train_distill.py`:
  teacher = frozen model at 8 s8-iterations, student trains refine_s8 only to
  match it in 3 iterations. No GT used. Status: code written; NOT yet run.
- **Option G (uncertainty head)**: being added to the v2-dev decoder's convex
  branch: one extra head output channel = per-query error scale b (Laplace),
  loss |err|/b + log b on the final iteration, flag `--uncertainty`.
  Old checkpoints unaffected (flag off = identical architecture).
  Status: in progress.
- **Local GPU broken** (driver error 804 after suspend; reboot pending), so
  local verification is CPU-only today; GPU validation happens on Explorer.
- **Cluster state**: env rebuild job 8718244 queued (partition short); five
  training jobs dependency-chained behind it were submitted from the
  v3-rebuild checkout and will be CANCELLED and resubmitted from v3-dev once
  this branch is pushed and checked out on the cluster.
